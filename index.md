### Research Fellow, University of Glasgow

<img src="./img/sstein_2022.jpg" alt-text="Sebastian Stein" width="210px" align="left" vspace="5px" hspace="10px"/> Sebastian is a Research Fellow in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. His research focus is on shared autonomy (human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization, intelligent interactive systems, assistive technology) and intelligent agents (active inference, reinforcement learning), with interests in HCI, ubiquitous computing and machine learning.

He received his German Diplom (MSc. equivalent) in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the Technical University of Dortmund in 2010. He was awarded his PhD in Computing from the University of Dundee in 2014 for his work on recognising manipulation actions and methods for fusing data from video and embedded accelerometer. He continued his research as postdoctoral research assistant in Dundee before joining the University of Glasgow as Research Associate in 2016 and continuing in Glasgow as Research Fellow in 2023.
